        <section name="News">
            <p><strong>JETT 0.2.0 (Beta) Released</strong></p>
            <p>New in JETT 0.2.0:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>New tags: <a href="tags/comment.html">"comment"</a> to create Excel Comments on
                Cells, <a href="tags/group.html">"group"</a> to define Excel Groups (Outlines), and
                <a href="tags/hyperlink.html">"hyperlink"</a> to create Hyperlinks on Cells.</li>
                <li>It is now possible to create Excel Groups (Outlines) on dynamically placed data
                using <a href="tags/looping.html">looping tags</a> such as the
                <a href="tags/forEach.html">forEach tag</a>.  It is also possible to specify new
                metadata to create Excel Groups using <a href="collections/implicit.html">Implicit
                Collections Processing</a>.</li>
                <li>JETT has supported Rich Text using Expressions, but now it supports Rich Text
                inside certain appropriate tag attributes that are used as actual Cell contents.</li>
                <li>It is now possible to supply <a href="misc/jexl_settings.html">custom functions</a>
                into a custom JEXL namespace, which can result in such Expressions as
                <code>${custom:method(param)}</code>.</li>
                <li>Additional convenience "transform" methods in the <code>ExcelTransformer</code>
                class allow the developer to specify input and output filenames, and to let JETT
                handle the reading and writing of the Excel files.</li>
                <li>Lots of JUnit test cases have been added for all the new features, and for lots
                of old features that needed them.</li>
                <li>Two bugs are fixed relating to JETT Formulas.  One bug did not pick up the cell
                reference if it was at the end of the JETT Formula, and another bug did not allow
                negative default values to be supplied in a formula cell reference.  Both bugs are
                now fixed.</li>
            </ul>

        <section name="Overview">
            <p>JETT (Java Excel Template Translator) is a Java 5.0 API that allows speedy creation
            of Excel spreadsheet reports using Excel spreadsheet templates.</p>
            <p>JETT is built on top of the <a href="http://poi.apache.org/">Apache POI</a> library,
            which gives almost total control to the developer over the reading, creation, and
            modification of Excel spreadsheets.  This includes the very tedious, verbose, and
            error-prone process of coding cell and text formatting, including font, color,
            highlighting, borders, alignment, header/footer, etc.</p>
            <p>JETT is also built on top of the <a href="http://commons.apache.org/jexl/">Apache
            Commons JEXL library</a> (Java Expression Language), which allows expressions to be
            evaluated easily.</p>
            <p>Additionally, JETT uses the <a href="http://jagg.sourceforge.net">jAgg</a> library
            (Java Aggregations) to perform aggregate operations, such as Sum and Average, and
            display the calculations in the spreadsheet.</p>
            <p>JETT allows the developer to follow the MVC pattern easily.  JETT is the Controller,
            the developer creates the Model, and either the developer or another party controls the
            Excel spreadsheet template, which acts as the View.</p>
            <p>To summarize JETT, the developer supplies an Excel spreadsheet <em>template</em>,
            which provides the structure, layout, and styling of the resultant spreadsheet.  Then,
            the developer creates <em>beans</em> that contain the actual data to be populated in
            the spreadsheet.  Finally, the developer calls the JETT API to transform the template
            spreadsheet into the resultant spreadsheet, complete with the desired data, which can
            then be published.</p>
        </section>
        <section name="Main Features">
            <ul>
                <li>Integration with <a href="http://commons.apache.org/jexl/">Apache Commons JEXL
                    </a> 2.1.1 (Java Expression Language).  This allows for easy creation of
                    expressions that are substituted with model data in the form of beans at
                    runtime.</li>
                <li>Integration with <a href="http://poi.apache.org/">Apache POI</a> 3.8.  JETT is
                    built on top of the extensive Apache POI library with which it controls sheet
                    transformations.</li>
                <li>Integration with the SourceForge project
                    <a href="http://jagg.sourceforge.net">jAgg</a> 0.5.0.  JETT uses this library
                    to evaluate Aggregate Expressions, a JETT-based extension to JEXL that allows
                    aggregate expressions to be evaluated, such as Sum, Count, Avg, etc.</li>
                <li>Built-in Tag library that allows XML-like tags to be placed in template
                    spreadsheets, allowing such simple programming-like constructs as “if”, “for”,
                    “forEach”, and more.</li>
                <li>Looping tags support “copy down” and “copy right” behavior for the display of
                    Collections.</li>
                <li>Custom Tag Libraries may be coded and supplied to JETT for execution.</li>
                <li>Like Apache POI, JETT attempts as much as possible to keep existing Excel
                    features intact, including Charts, Macros, etc.</li>
                <li>The CellListener interface allows dynamic, custom processing of Cells, such as
                    alternate row highlighting, value manipulation, etc.</li>
                <li>Merged cell regions are shifted and copied as appropriate.</li>
                <li>Row heights and columns widths are respected as best as possible.</li>
                <li>Template sheets may be dynamically cloned and separately evaluated in the
                    resultant spreadsheet.</li>
                <li>Multiple collections may be implicitly processed using a single loop.</li>
                <li>It is possible to implement and display adjacent, or side-by-side, lists.</li>
                <li>Supports binary Excel (.xls) and XML Excel (.xlsx) documents.</li>
                <li>RichTextStrings are supported, even within Expressions.</li>
                <li>JETT gives access to POI Objects in JEXL Expressions, which in turn allows
                    access to Workbook and Sheet properties, including the Header &amp; Footer, and
                    PageSetup objects.</li>
                <li>Excel Formula generation support.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section name="Requirements">
