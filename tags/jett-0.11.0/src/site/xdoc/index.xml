        <section name="News">
            <p><strong>JETT 0.11.0 (Beta) Released</strong></p>
            <p>New in JETT 0.11.0:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ticket #68: If a "&lt;" character is inside the body of a tag, JETT had
                    mistakenly parsed it as the beginning of a tag and thrown a
                    <code>TagParseException</code>.  This is now parsed correctly.</li>
                <li>Ticket #71: Create a tag to set the value of a variable.  JETT now has the new
                    <a href="tags/set.html">set tag</a> to assign a value to a variable in the
                    beans map.</li>
                <li>Ticket #74: The "findCellStyleWithFont" method didn't cache a font object if
                    the font was not found and a new one is created.  Now it does cache it.</li>
                <li>Ticket #76: The "rows" and "cols" attributes on the
                    <a href="tags/image.html">image tag</a> had no effect and weren't working.
                    This is now fixed in JETT.</li>
                <li>Ticket #77: Performance issues, calling "copyColumnWidthsRight" when a
                    rightward looping tag is embedded in a downward looping tag.  Now JETT will only
                    set column widths on the first iteration of the inner, rightward looping tag.</li>
                <li>Ticket #78: Extraneous blank cells created upon processing of nested
                    <code>jt:forEach</code> tags.  The logic has been updated and now this has been
                    resolved.</li>
                <li>Ticket #79: Implicit Sheet cloning fails if the collection contains exactly
                    one element.  There was an off-by-one error in the logic.  This has been
                    resolved.</li>
                <li>Ticket #81: Add a "page break" tag.  JETT now has the new
                    <a href="tags/pageBreak.html">pageBreak tag</a></li>
                <li>Ticket #82: In JETT Formulas, a cell reference doesn't get updated unless there
                    is a space in front of punctuation/operators.  The JETT formula parser has been
                    fixed to recognize the case of a new cell reference following a comma, a right
                    parenthesis, or a double-quote character.</li>
                <li>Ticket #85: Use a logging library instead of printing to System.err.  JETT is
                    now using Log4J 2, version 2.9.0.  Because Log4J 2 requires JDK 1.7, now JETT
                    requires at least JDK 1.7 as well.</li>
                <li>Ticket #86: Existing hyperlinks in a template spreadsheet are not shifted,
                    copied, or moved.  JETT had ignored existing hyperlinks in a template
                    spreadsheet; now they are shifted, copied, and moved when appropriate.</li>
                <li>Ticket #87: Add an attribute evaluation method for non-negative doubles.  Now
                    <code>AttributeUtil</code> has a method for validating that an attribute
                    contains a non-negative double value.</li>

        <section name="Overview">
            <p>JETT (Java Excel Template Translator) is a Java 7 API that allows speedy creation
            of Excel spreadsheet reports using Excel spreadsheet templates.</p>
            <p>JETT is built on top of the <a href="http://poi.apache.org/">Apache POI</a> library,
            which gives almost total control to the developer over the reading, creation, and
            modification of Excel spreadsheets.  This includes the very tedious, verbose, and
            error-prone process of coding cell and text formatting, including font, color,
            highlighting, borders, alignment, header/footer, etc.</p>
            <p>JETT is also built on top of the <a href="http://commons.apache.org/jexl/">Apache
            Commons JEXL library</a> (Java Expression Language), which allows expressions to be
            evaluated easily.</p>
            <p>Additionally, JETT uses the <a href="http://jagg.sourceforge.net">jAgg</a> library
            (Java Aggregations) to perform aggregate operations, such as Sum and Average, and
            super-aggregation operations, such as rollups and cubes, and display the calculations
            in the spreadsheet.  It also uses jAgg to perform analytic operations, such as Lag,
            Lead, and RatioToReport.</p>
            <p>JETT allows the developer to follow the MVC pattern easily.  JETT is the Controller,
            the developer creates the Model, and either the developer or another party controls the
            Excel spreadsheet template, which acts as the View.</p>
            <p>To summarize JETT, the developer supplies an Excel spreadsheet <em>template</em>,
            which provides the structure, layout, and styling of the resultant spreadsheet.  Then,
            the developer creates <em>beans</em> that contain the actual data to be populated in
            the spreadsheet.  Finally, the developer uses an
            <a href="apidocs/net/sf/jett/transform/ExcelTransformer.html"><code>ExcelTransformer</code></a>,
            the JETT API entry point, to transform the template spreadsheet into the resultant
            spreadsheet, complete with the desired data, which can then be published.</p>
        </section>
        <section name="Main Features">
            <ul>
                <li>Integration with <a href="http://commons.apache.org/jexl/">Apache Commons JEXL
                    </a> 2.1.1 (Java Expression Language).  This allows for easy creation of
                    expressions that are substituted with model data in the form of beans at
                    runtime.</li>
                <li>Integration with <a href="http://poi.apache.org/">Apache POI</a> 3.14.  JETT is
                    built on top of the extensive Apache POI library with which it controls sheet
                    transformations.</li>
                <li>Integration with the SourceForge project
                    <a href="http://jagg.sourceforge.net">jAgg</a> 0.9.0.  JETT uses this library
                    to evaluate Aggregate Expressions, a JETT-based extension to JEXL that allows
                    aggregate expressions to be evaluated, such as Sum, Count, Avg, etc.</li>
                <li>Built-in Tag library that allows XML-like tags to be placed in template
                    spreadsheets, allowing such simple programming-like constructs as “if”, “for”,
                    “forEach”, and more.</li>
                <li>Looping tags support “copy down” and “copy right” behavior for the display of
                    Collections.</li>
                <li>Custom Tag Libraries may be coded and supplied to JETT for execution.</li>
                <li>Like Apache POI, JETT attempts as much as possible to keep existing Excel
                    features intact, including Charts, Macros, etc.</li>
                <li>The CellListener interface allows dynamic, custom processing of Cells, such as
                    alternate row highlighting, value manipulation, etc.</li>
                <li>Merged cell regions are shifted and copied as appropriate.</li>
                <li>Row heights and columns widths are respected as best as possible.</li>
                <li>Template sheets may be dynamically cloned and separately evaluated in the
                    resultant spreadsheet.</li>
                <li>Multiple collections may be implicitly processed using a single loop.</li>
                <li>It is possible to implement and display adjacent, or side-by-side, lists.</li>
                <li>Supports binary Excel (.xls) and XML Excel (.xlsx) documents.</li>
                <li>RichTextStrings are supported, even within Expressions.</li>
                <li>JETT gives access to POI Objects in JEXL Expressions, which in turn allows
                    access to Workbook and Sheet properties, including the Header &amp; Footer, and
                    PageSetup objects.</li>
                <li>Excel Formula generation support.</li>
                <li>JDBC Query Execution inside the template.</li>
            </ul>
