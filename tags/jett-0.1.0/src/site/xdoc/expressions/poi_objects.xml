            <p>During transformation, the current POI Sheet object is exposed in the beans map as
            the bean name "sheet".  Also, the entire POI Workbook object is exposed in the beans
            map as the bean name "workbook".  This allows for Expressions that set "off sheet"
            properties such as the Header, Footer, and PrintSetup.</p>
            <p>Because some of these examples call methods with a return type of "void",
            the Expressions themselves that do so evaluate to <code>null</code> and the cells that
            contain them will be blanked out.  Note: JEXL Expressions allow String literals to be
            enclosed in single quotes.</p>

        <p>After transformation, the above group of cells looks like this.</p>

        <p>The Header and Footer objects are populated, and they are seen when switching to Excel's
        "Page Layout" View.</p>
